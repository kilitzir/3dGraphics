# Old-Graphics
A project  I have done back in the 80s, early 90s (?). I can't remember writing it, so please don't ask me how it works.
I think it's Turbo C.
You can use it how you like as much as you like

Also, in Folder " Turbo Pascal", you'll find the code for the same thing in Pascal, Turbo Pascal.
